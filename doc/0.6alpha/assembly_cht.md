- **C33**	*(0.1µF)* located bottom center between R32 and D11.
- **C36**	*(1µF)* located bottom center between JP6 and D12. 
- **R31**	*(2.49k ohm)* located bottom center between D12 and D10.
- **R32**	*(470 ohm)* located bottom center between D12 and C33.
- **D12**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the PCB. This is indicated by the white line.
- **D13**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the left edge of the PCB. This is indicated by the white line.
- **JP6**	This is just a wire jumper.  You can use one of the diode leads that you snipped off for this jumper.
