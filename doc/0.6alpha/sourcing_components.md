## Sourcing the components

You might already have some of the components, omit those.


#### If you prefer Digi-Key:

Digi-Key BOM equivalent has been the only BOM developed for the Jaguar Revision A3 board at this time.


#### If you prefer Newark, Mouser or Element14:

Unfortunately Newark, Mouser or Element14 BOM equivalents have not yet been developed for the Jaguar Revision A3 board, if you develop one that works let me know and I will include it in the repository.


Just copy and paste the supplier part numbers for required components to the relevant suppliers shopping cart.
