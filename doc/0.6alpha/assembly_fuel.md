- **R53**	*(2.4k ohm)* located bottom lower right between D30 and D40. 
- **R54**	*(1k ohm)* located bottom lower right below R8. 
- **R63**	*(100k ohm)* located bottom lower right below D1. 
- **D30**	*(LED Red)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the bottom edge of the PCB. This is indicated by the short lead of the LED.
- **D31**	*(1N4148)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the left edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.



#### FAN circuit
**Step 26 :**

- **R72**	*(2.4k ohm)*
- **R74**	*(1k ohm)*
- **R73**	*(100k ohm)*
- **D39**	*(LED Red)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the short lead of the LED.
- **D40**	*(1N4148)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.



#### Accessory circuit
**Step 27 :**

- **R75**	*(2.4k ohm)*
- **R77**	*(1k ohm)*
- **R76**	*(100k ohm)*
- **D41**	*(LED Red)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the bottom edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the short lead of the LED.
- **D42**	*(1N4148)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the bottom edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
