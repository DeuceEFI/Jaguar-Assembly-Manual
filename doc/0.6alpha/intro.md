# Introduction #

It is assumed that you came to this guide from one of the main sites, if not, see the [Jaguar] forum for more specific information on this design.

The goal of the Jaguar project is to create a hardware solution for FreeEMS that caters to the needs of the General Motors 4/6/8 cylinder engines running either an electronic advance distributor or wasted spark DIS system.  The Jaguar board can also be used for other 4/6/8 cylinder engines using a Ford EDIS ignition system.  The TC442x ICs specified in the Bill of Materials and in these assembly instructions can be used as logic level (5v) outputs to the logic level inputs on EDIS/DIS modules or battery voltage (13.6 to 14.4v) outputs. 

This version of the manual includes instructions for the **Jaguar Version 0.6-alpha PCBs**, which were produced as a small run of 10 bare PCBs by Andy Goss in September 2013. 

- You will need to purchase parts required for your build, these are listed in [the BOM](#using_bom) then install those parts.
- The board can be programmed via a USB connection to your computer.
