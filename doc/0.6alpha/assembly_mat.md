- **C28**	*(0.1µF)* located bottom left center between R26 and C32.
- **C30**	*(1µF)* located lower left center between R13 and D9. 
- **R24**	*(2.49k ohm)* located lower left center between D16 and R26. 
- **R26**	*(470 ohm)* located lower left center between R24 and C28.
- **D8**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
- **D9**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the bottom edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
