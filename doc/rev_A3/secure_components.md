Once you have installed all of the components, you will need to place a small amount of High Temperature Silicone on the legs of the upright components to brace them against damage from vibration.  Do not place any silicone near the MAP sensor, it should be mounted to the PCB using nylon screws with locking nylon nuts (be sure not to tighten too tighly or you may damage the MAP sensor).
