- **C20**	*(0.22µF)* located left center between C21 and R13.	
- **C22**	*(0.22µF)* located left center between U6 and C20.
- **C21**	*(0.33µF)* located left center between C23 and C44.	
- **C23**	*(0.01µF)* located left center between U6 and C21.	
- **R13**	*(1k ohm)* located left center between C20 and D16. 
- **U6**	*(MPX4100AP)* for normally aspirated version, if for boosted application use MPX4250AP instead.
