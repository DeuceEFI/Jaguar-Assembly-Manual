- **R28**	*(470 ohm)* located center left between D7 and R29.
- **R29**	*(3.9k ohm)* located center left between C28 and C36.	
- **R30**	*(1k ohm)* located center left between C27 and C32.
- **C27**	*(0.22µF)* located center left between D7 and R30.
- **C32**	*(0.1µF)* located center left between R30 and R29.
- **D6**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the left side of the PCB towards the white line.  It is located center left between C4 and D7.
- **D7**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the right side of the PCB towards the white line.  It is located center left between D6 and C27.
