- **C35**	*(0.1µF)* located bottom lower left below C34.
- **C37**	*(0.22µF)* located bottom lower left between C35 and R34. 
- **R34**	*(470 ohm)* located bottom lower left between C37 and D15.
- **D14**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the bottom edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
- **D15**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
