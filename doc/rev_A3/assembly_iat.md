- **C29**	*(0.1µF)* located bottom center between C31 and D31.
- **C31**	*(1µF)* located bottom center between C33 and C29. 
- **R25**	*(2.49k ohm)* located bottom center between D12 and D11. 
- **R27**	*(470 ohm)* located bottom center between D11 and C29.
- **D10**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
- **D11**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
- **JP5**	This is just a wire jumper.  You can use one of the diode leads that you snipped off for this jumper.
