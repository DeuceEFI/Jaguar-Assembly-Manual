# Introduction

#####First of all I would like to thank Fred Cooke for his contribution to the firmware that this EMS uses. &nbsp; Second, I would like to thank Preston Saunders who originally created the Puma-HowTo documentation of which this work is directly based on. &nbsp; Third, I would like to thank all of the diyefi.org members who have reviewed my schematics and PCB design to make the Jaguar PCB a truly world class EMS platform! 

This guide will show you how to choose the components, how to order the components, how to build your Jaguar Revision A.3 board and how to properly connect it to a vehicle.

It is assumed that you came to this guide from one of the main sites, if not, see the main [FreeEMS.org] site for general information, and the [Jaguar] site for more specific information on this design.

This version of the manual includes instructions for the **Revision A.3 board**, which was produced as a small one-off run of just 4 bare PCBs by Andy Goss. You will need to purchase parts required for your build, these are listed in [the BOM](#using_bom), perform [PCB corrections](#assembly_essential_mods) then install those parts. You will also need to program the Serial Monitor via the BDM programming port to get a functional boot loader installed. After the Serial Monitor is flashed with the BDM the board can be programmed via a USB connection to your computer.
