# Introduction

It is assumed that you came to this guide from one of the main sites, if not, see the main [FreeEMS.org] site for general information, and the [Jaguar] forum for more specific information on this design.

This version of the manual includes instructions for the **Jaguar Revision A3 board**, which was produced as a small one-off run of just 4 bare PCBs by Andy Goss. &nbsp; You will need to purchase parts required for your build, these are listed in [the BOM](#using_bom) then install those parts. Then you will also need to program the Serial Monitor via the BDM programming port to get a functional boot loader installed. After the Serial Monitor is flashed with the BDM, the board can be programmed via a USB connection to your computer.
