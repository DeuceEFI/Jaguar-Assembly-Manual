# Introduction #

It is assumed that you came to this guide from one of the main sites, if not, see the [Jaguar] forum for more specific information on this design.

The goal of the Jaguar project is to create a hardware solution for FreeEMS that caters to the needs of the General Motors 4/6/8 cylinder engines running either an electronic advance distributor or wasted spark DIS system.  The Jaguar board can also be used for other 4/6/8 cylinder engines using a Ford EDIS ignition system.  The exclusive-OR gate specified in the Bill of Materials and in these assembly instructions is ONLY to be used as logic level outputs to the logic level inputs on EDIS/DIS modules! 

This version of the manual includes instructions for the **Jaguar Revision A3 board**, which was produced as a small run of just 5 bare PCBs by Andy Goss in March 2012. 

- You will need to purchase parts required for your build, these are listed in [the BOM](#using_bom) then install those parts.
- The board can be programmed via a USB connection to your computer.
