#### Injector 1
**Step 31 :**

- **R47**	*(2.4k ohm)*
- **R41**	*(1k ohm)*
- **R35**	*(100k ohm)*
- **D18**	*(LED Red)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the top edge of the board. This is indicated by the short lead of the LED.
- **D24**	*(1N4148)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the bottom edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
