## Ignition System ##

###Connect the following ignition system connections to the Jaguar board:

- **DIS-Bypass**	Located in the lower left section of the board near R65. This should be connected to the **TAN/BLACK** wire on most GM DIS or HEI modules.
- **IGN-Advance**	Located in the lower left section of the board near R15.  This should be connected to the **WHITE** (EST) wire on most GM DIS or HEI modules.


## Fuel, Fan and Accessory Outputs ##

###Fuel Pump Relay

- **Fuel-**	Located in the upper left section of the board between C29 and D30.  This should be connected to the **GREEN/WHITE** wire that controls the Fuel Pump Relay on most GM vehicles.


###Fan Relay

- **FAN-**	Located in the upper left section of the board between R73 and R74.  This should be connected to the negative wire that controls the radiator cooling Fan Relay.  This can also be used to supply a pulse width modulated input to a variable speed fan controller that you supply external to the Jaguar board.  See the [Jaguar] forum for more details.


###Accessory Relay
