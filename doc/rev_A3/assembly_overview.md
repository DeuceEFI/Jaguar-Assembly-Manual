# Assembling the board #

**The [schematics] are the definite guide to what component goes in what position and can be opened with any PDF viewer.**

Optionally the repository with all development files can be cloned. Click on [clone Jaguar] for further details.

This is a 'hand assembly' process, and therefore the components will be placed from the center of the PCB out toward the four edges, starting with the components that require the most amount of work to mount.
All through-hole components will be populated after the reflow process has been performed. 

#### Important: An anti-static surface must be present during assembly; an anti-static wrist strap should also be worn at all times.

For future reference if a component direction is not specified it is **non-polarised** and can be mounted in either direction.

The component placement directions will always be referenced in the following manner:

- PCB TOP (SMD) side orientation: 
	- "**DeuceEFI**", "**Jaguar**", "**Rev A3**" and "**designed for FreeEMS**" will always be visible on the right hand side.

- PCB BOTTOM (Through Hole) side orientation:
	- All "**R**", "**C**", "**JP**" and the wire connection point silkscreens will be visible on this side.  The U6 (MPX4100AP) silk screen is located to the right side and U3 will be in the lower left side.  You should not see any of the SMD components, they should be on the back side of the board. 


**Follow these steps in order:**
