- **C34**	*(0.1µF)* located bottom lower left between D17 and C35.
- **C38**	*(0.22µF)* located bottom lower left between D16 and D17. 
- **R33**	*(470 ohm)* located bottom lower left between C38 and R34.
- **D16**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the right edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
- **D17**	*(1N5818-TP)* Direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the right edge of the PCB.  This is indicated by the white line.
