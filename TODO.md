# To Do List

## JAG 09/15/2013 1355 EDT (GMT-0400)

### Things to change for version 0.6-alpha PCB assembly manual:

* Builder should build power supplies early on and measure them to be sure they're close to 5V so the clamp doesn't fight.
* When the clamp component have been installed, they should make sure nothing is drawing too much current/getting hot.
* Create an installation notes section at the beginning of the installation_overview to put:
** "Injectors must be high-z/high-impedance/saturated type, use of low-Z could damage your injectors or the Jaguar injector drivers/PCB traces"
** "Maximum or 4 high-z injectors per channel (IF they are 12 ohm each)"
** "If possible, run a separate wire for the BRV input"
** "Ensure that your high power and CPU grounds are completely separate all the way to your block/battery"
