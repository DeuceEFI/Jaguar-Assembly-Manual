{"body":"# Jaguar PCB for FreeEMS construction documentation repository\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a repository for documenting the assembly of a Jaguar Revision A.3 PCB for FreeEMS.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is written in markdown syntax and can be converted to\r\nmany formats, including HTML and PDF (only HTML generated with the included\r\nbuild script).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe build script is written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), so you'll need to have Ruby installed.\r\n\r\nSome old versions of doesn't come with [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/), so install that separately if you don't have a `gem` command available.\r\n\r\nThe script itself depends on one of these [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) libraries (in order of preference):\r\n\r\n* `rpeg-markdown`\r\n* `rdiscount`\r\n* `bluecloth` (2.x and newer, not 1.0, which is broken)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install the dependency, run:\r\n    sudo gem install rpeg-markdown\r\n\r\nIf that fails (invalid build environment or such), try one of the others, like:\r\n    sudo gem install rdiscount\r\n\r\nYou can even have all of them installed, if you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo build the documentation, run the build script:\r\n    ruby build.rb\r\n\r\n..or:\r\n    ./build.rb\r\n\r\nDoing that will build a HTML pages into the html directory.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n* Read the [Markdown reference manual](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\r\n* Fork this project on [github](https://github.com/).\r\n* Edit contents of the [doc/revA3]() directory or create another directory with\r\n  similar structure.\r\n* Ensure the output of `build.rb` is valid (it's built into the [html/]() -directory). Edit the .md files until it is!\r\n* Commit and push your changes\r\n  * Notify the original author with a pull request, if you use a fork.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contacting us\r\n\r\n- IRC: `#freeems-dev` on the FreeNode network and mention DeuceEFI\r\n- Web: [http://freeems.org/]()\r\n- Forum: [http://forum.diyefi.org]()\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
