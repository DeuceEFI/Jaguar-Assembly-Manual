<h1>Baking the Assembled PCB</h1>

<p><em>BAKING DETAILS</em>
- Place the completed board(s) in your reflow soldering oven and start the reflow cycle.
- Once the cycle is complete and the board(s) have cooled, remove them from the reflow oven for inspection.</p>

<h4>AFTER BAKING INSPECTION</h4>

<ul>
<li>Check the entire PCB for Solder bridges, especially on <strong>MCU (U1), U7, U4 and all the Qs</strong></li>
<li>Examine the new solder joints for dryness, this is normally depicted by dull looking solder, it all should be rather shinny.</li>
<li>Clear any solder beads that may have formed on the PCB, this can easily be performed by using a tooth brush and giving the PCB a quick and careful scrub.</li>
</ul>

<h4>AFTER BAKING TESTING</h4>

<p><strong>Testing MCU for solder bridges</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set your DMM for measuring resistance 200 ohm range should be OK;

<ul>
<li>Check from one MCU (U1) pin to the next to make sure they are not shorted together.

<ul>
<li>There is one exception, only MCU (U1) pins 85 and 86 should show shorted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check from one USB UART (U7) pin to the next to make sure they are not shorted together.

<ul>
<li>There is one exception, only USB UART (U7) pins 25 and 26 should show shorted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check from one MAX9926 (U4) pin to the next to make sure they are not shorted together.

<ul>
<li>There is no exception.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check from one VNN7NV0413TR (Q9-11) pin to the others to make sure they are not shorted together.

<ul>
<li>Also make sure that no pin is shorted to ground.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check from one VND7NV04 (Q1-8) pin to the others to make sure they are not shorted together.

<ul>
<li>Also make sure that no pin is shorted to ground.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
